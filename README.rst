Professional Experience
-----------------------

| **Senior Software Engineer (Contract) – Toro Rosso Formula 1**
| **October 2016 - March 2019 (4 renewals)**
|
| Assisted the aero dynamics team at Toro Rosso F1 deliver significant quanities of aero simulation (CFD) data to users, by developing a large, single-page web application in Python, Django, Django REST Framework, KnockoutJS, PostgreSQL, Celery, Docker.
| 
| **Key activities:**

- Working in sprints to deliver bug fixes and new features in the Javascript UI and Django/REST backend.

- Liaising closely with domain experts and aero teams to understand and define requirements.

- Reviewing team code, flagging potential issues, testing and merging pull requests.

- Resolving operational issues under pressure, analysing logs, inspecting processes, monitoring SQL.

- Improving robustness through:

  - Building up comprehensive test coverage, introducing Selenium, integrating with CI.
  - Reworking long running Celery tasks to support auto-restart on failure.
  - Investigating and addressing errors logged in Sentry.
  - Retaining team knowledge by introducing a wiki.

- Optimising performance through:

  - Identifying slow SQL queries and modifying corresponding Django ORM code.
  - Monitoring and restructuring Celery queues for optimal liveness.
  - Parallelising filesystem I/O to take advantage of highly parallel attached storage.

- Creating a predictable, low risk release process by reducing a series of manual steps to a single Make command that leveraged the container based architecture.

- Mentoring interns, assisting them with problem solving and feature design.

|
| **Senior Software Engineer (Contract) – University of Oxford**
| **January 2016 - August 2016 (3 renewals)**
|
| Worked as a consultant senior software engineer at the Bodleian Library to assist the organisation in migrating its publication platform to a new architecture, using Python, RabbitMQ, Linux, Git, Jenkins.
|

- Used Python, XML, Solr, SPARQL to build a family of loosely coupled modules that formed part of a message-driven workflow, enabling both engineers, and end users, to publish and index content.

|
| **Senior Software Engineer (Contract) – Jaguar Landrover**
| **May 2015 - December 2015 (2 renewals)**
|
| Worked at Jaguar Landrover on the Self Learning Car (SLC). The SLC system learns patterns of driver behaviour and can automatically activate in-car features depending upon who is driving the vehicle.
|

- Used Python/JSON/REST to implement a prototype of the "self-learning climate" feature for the SLC. Successfully delivered the prototype into user trials, allowing the business to evaluate the concept, make refinements and ultimately decide upon its applicability for production road cars.

- Used an incremental test-driven approach to develop the feature with regular in-car demonstrations to stakeholders, to showcase new functionality and gather feedback.

- Responsible for the implementation of the Smart Traffic Alerts feature into the SLC. This feature, written in Python and Javascript/JQuery, displayed a map on the car's dashboard when traffic problems were detected ahead. It interacted with the Google Maps Directions API and Bing Routes API.

|
| **Senior Software Engineer (Contract) – ARM**
| **February 2014 – April 2015 (3 renewals)**
|
| Worked with a team of GPU performance engineers helping them and their customers visualise performance data by creating a data-driven, single page web application, using AngularJS, Python and MongoDB.
|

- Responsible for the design and development of the UI and Python backend, creating charts and other visualisations using AngularJS/HTML5/Bootstrap/Pandas.

- Worked in two-weekly iterations to consistently deliver new features on time and within the estimates given in sprint planning meetings, using an automated deployment process for regular releases to production.

- Collaborated closely with domain experts on the team to ensure that complex data was conveyed in a clear and consistent way, appropriate for an audience consisting of both engineers and management.

- Ensured consistently good UI performance with large quantities of data through:

  - use of caching at different levels within the architecture
  - use of Python sub-processes to manage server-side memory usage
  - identification of hotspots in the JavaScript/Python code using browser developer tools and Python cProfile
  - keeping the AngularJS digest cycle lightweight – e.g. using one-time bindings where appropriate

- Introduced a suite of frontend and backend automated tests using Jasmine, PyTest and Jenkins. Encouraged other developers to participate in writing tests and improve coverage by advocating the benefits of testing. This helped to reduce the number of post-release "hotfixes" and gave developers more confidence in undertaking code restructuring.
