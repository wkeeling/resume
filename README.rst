| **Senior Software Engineer (Contract) – Toro Rosso Formula 1 Team**
| **October 2016 - March 2019 (4 renewals)**
|
| Assisted the aero dynamics team at Toro Rosso F1 deliver significant quanities of aero simulation (CFD) data to users, by developing a large, single-page web application in Python/Django, KnockoutJS, PostgreSQL, Celery, Docker.



|
| **Senior Software Engineer (Contract) – University of Oxford**
| **January 2016 - August 2016 (3 renewals)**
|
| Worked as a consultant senior software engineer at the Bodleian Library to assist the organisation in migrating its publication platform to a new architecture, using Python, RabbitMQ, Linux, Git, Jenkins.

- Used Python, XML, Solr, SPARQL to build a family of loosely coupled modules that formed part of a message-driven workflow, enabling both engineers, and end users, to publish and index content.

| **Senior Software Engineer (Contract) – Jaguar Landrover**
| **May 2015 - December 2015 (2 renewals)**
|
| Worked at Jaguar Landrover Research on the Self Learning Car (SLC). The SLC system learns patterns of driver behaviour and can automatically activate in-car features depending upon who is driving the vehicle.

- Used Python to implement a prototype of the “self-learning climate” feature for the SLC. Successfully delivered the prototype into user trials, allowing the business to evaluate the concept, make refinements and ultimately decide upon its applicability for production road cars.

- Analysed the data coming out of the cars in the user trial and making appropriate refinements. For example, refining the nearest neighbour algorithm to ensure heated seat activation, even if no immediate data available.

- Used an incremental test-driven approach to develop the feature with regular in-car demonstrations to stakeholders, showcasing new functionality and gathering feedback.

- Responsible for the implementation of the Smart Traffic Alerts feature into the SLC. This feature, written in Python and Javascript/JQuery, displayed a map on the car’s dashboard when traffic problems were detected ahead. It interacted with the Google Maps Directions API and Bing Routes API.
